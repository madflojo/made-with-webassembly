Framework for building distributed services and functions with Web Assembly

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madflojo/tarmac/main/docs/tarmac-logo.png)

Tarmac is a unique framework designed for the next generation of distributed systems. At its core, like many other microservice frameworks, Tarmac is focused on abstracting the complexities of building cloud-native services allowing users to focus more on business logic and less on boilerplate code.

What makes Tarmac unique is that, unlike most microservice frameworks, Tarmac is language agnostic. Using Web Assembly (WASM), Tarmac users can write their business logic in many different languages such as Rust, Go, Javascript, or even Swift; and run it all using the same core framework.
